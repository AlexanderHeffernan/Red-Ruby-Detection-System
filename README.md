# Red Ruby Theft Detection System

This project, completed as part of a first year engineering course at Victoria University of Wellington, is implemented in C++ and uses input from a camera to identify the theft of a "Red Ruby". The system continuously monitors the environment using a camera and performs image processing to detect the presence of a red object resembling a ruby.

## Project Overview

The Red Ruby Theft Detection System is designed to provide real-time monitoring and detection of theft incidents involving a valuable red ruby. The system utilizes the E101 library for interfacing with the camera and performing image processing tasks. 

## Features

- Continuous monitoring of the environment using a camera
- Real-time image processing to detect the presence of a red object
- Triggering an alarm, indicating a potential theft incident
